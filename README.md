## Meeting 20-02-2020 [Gjorgji]
- Pitched the idea of a time line correlation visualization against objects/concepts
- Changed the idea to portrait art work
  -  The view on beauty changes over time. Therefore we use the OmniArt dataset to filter the portraits and see what the color usage is (at first). For example back in the day pale skin was a sign of beauty, later on this changed.
- Use of OmniEye dataset
- Use of OmniEye generator
